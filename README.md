# Telecom-Customer-Retention-Prediction
📋 Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning solution to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. The model helps identify customers who are likely to cancel their services, enabling proactive retention strategies.

🎯 Business Problem

Customer churn (customer attrition) is a critical metric for businesses. Predicting which customers are likely to leave allows companies to take preventive measures and improve customer retention.

📊 Dataset

The project uses the Telco Customer Churn dataset containing information about:

7,043 customers
21 features including demographic info, services subscribed, account information, and churn status
Key Features:

Demographic: gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents
Services: PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, etc.
Account info: tenure, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod
Charges: MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges
Target: Churn (Yes/No)
🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3
Libraries:

Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Machine Learning: scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, XGBoost
Model Persistence: pickle
📈 Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing

Removed customerID (not useful for modeling)
Handled missing values in TotalCharges (replaced with 0)
Converted TotalCharges to numeric type
Addressed class imbalance in target variable
2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Analyzed distribution of numerical features (tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges)
Examined unique values across categorical variables
Identified data patterns and relationships
3. Feature Engineering

Label encoding for categorical variables
Handling class imbalance using SMOTE
Feature scaling and transformation
4. Model Development

Implemented multiple machine learning algorithms:

Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
XGBoost Classifier
5. Model Evaluation

Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report
Cross-validation

Length limit reached. DeepSeek can only read the first 21%.
We are given a Jupyter notebook that implements a customer churn prediction model using machine learning. The code is structured in cells and includes data loading, exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

We are to create a README file for GitHub that describes the project, the dataset, the steps taken, and how to run the code.

Let's break down the notebook to understand the steps:
Importing Dependencies: The necessary libraries are imported, including data manipulation (numpy, pandas), visualization (matplotlib, seaborn), preprocessing (LabelEncoder, SMOTE), model selection and training (train_test_split, cross_val_score, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, XGBClassifier), and metrics (accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report).
Data Loading and Understanding: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file. The shape, first few rows, and information about the dataset are displayed. The customerID column is dropped as it is not required for modeling.
Data Preprocessing:
The TotalCharges column is found to have 11 missing values (represented as spaces) which are replaced with 0.0 and then converted to float.
The target variable Churn is examined for class imbalance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The distribution of numerical features (tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges) is plotted using histograms with mean and median lines.
Insights:
The insights from the data are summarized, including the removal of customerID, handling missing values in TotalCharges, and noting the class imbalance.
The notebook is incomplete and stops at EDA. However, the initial steps are clear.

We can structure the README as follows:

Project Title

Installation
Usage

Since the notebook is incomplete, we will note that the modeling part is not included in the provided code.

Let's write the README accordingly.
